# Astro - The Tarot Whisperer

https://adinabo.github.io/Astro-The-Tarot-Whisperer/

Astro is an engaging and simple card-matching game where players are tasked with finding matching pairs of tarot cards. In this game, a selection of 10 unique tarot cards is duplicated, creating a total of 20 cards that players must match. The objective is to identify and match all pairs of cards.

Each game session starts with these 20 cards being thoroughly shuffled to ensure a unique and unpredictable arrangement, making every game a new and exciting challenge. Players will need to use their memory and concentration skills to remember the positions of the cards as they flip them over, aiming to find all matching pairs with as few mistakes as possible.

## UX Design Process

### Wireframes and Mock-ups 

Initially, my plan was to create a tarot reading website (initial wireframes below), but I decided that for this project it would be better to experiment with JavaScript and develop a simple and fun game using tarot cards.

The final layout was built based on the inital wireframe:

### Design Decisions and Reasoning

1. The card layout was designed to be simple and intuitive, with cards arranged in a grid to keep it simple.
2. The background was chosen to add a mystical and intriguing element to the game. 
3. The UI was designed to be clean, with a focus on the cards. 
4. The error counter was included to provide feedback to players.

## Features

- **Matching pairs of tarot cards:** Test your memory by finding matching tarot cards.
- **Simple and intuitive gameplay:** Easy to understand and play for all ages.
- **Fun and engaging:** Keeps players entertained with its magical theme.
- **"Start Game" button:** Resets the game to start a new session.
- **Error counter:** Tracks the number of incorrect matches and resets with each new game.
- **Sparkling stars background:** Adds a magical touch to the gameâ€™s atmosphere.

## How to Play

To start the game, the user will press the the Start Game button.

1. **Click to Reveal:** Click on a card to unveil its mystical symbol. Each card holds a unique image representing a facet of the tarot's wisdom. Take your time to absorb the energy of each card as it is revealed.
2. **Match the Symbols:** Click on another card to find its match. Use your memory to remember the positions of previously revealed cards.
3. **Find all Pairs:** Continue flipping cards and finding matching pairs until all cards are matched.
4. **Keep Track of Errors:** Each time you mismatch cards, the error counter will update, helping you track your progress.
5. **Restart the Game:** Click the "Start Game" button to reset the game and start a new round.

Each time the user matches the wrong cards, the error count will be updated to reflect the total number of errors.

When the user has successfully matched all the cards, a message will be displayed.

- Google Lighthouse
The page underwent testing with Google Lighthouse for both desktop and mobile platforms. Despite running the tests without any changes to the page, the Lighthouse results were inconsistent. This inconsistency appeared to be primarily due to layout shifts. Nevertheless, the scores remained acceptable. Through my own testing on various devices, I did not observe significant layout shifts. Even when applying throttling via devtools, there was only a minor layout shift during the initial load, which did not adversely affect the user experience.
