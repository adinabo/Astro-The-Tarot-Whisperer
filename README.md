# Astro - The Tarot Whisperer
https://adinabo.github.io/Astro-The-Tarot-Whisperer/

Astro is an engaging and simple card-matching game where players are tasked with finding matching pairs of tarot cards. In this game, a selection of 10 unique tarot cards is duplicated, creating a total of 20 cards that players must match. The objective is to identify and match all pairs of cards.

Each game session starts with these 20 cards being thoroughly shuffled to ensure a unique and unpredictable arrangement, making every game a new and exciting challenge. Players will need to use their memory and concentration skills to remember the positions of the cards as they flip them over, aiming to find all matching pairs with as few mistakes as possible.

Initially, my plan was to create a tarot reading website (initial wireframes below), but I decided that for this project it would be better to experiment with JavaScript and develop a simple and fun game using tarot cards.

## Features

- **Matching pairs of tarot cards:** Test your memory by finding matching tarot cards.
- **Simple and intuitive gameplay:** Easy to understand and play for all ages.
- **Fun and engaging:** Keeps players entertained with its magical theme.
- **"Start Game" button:** Resets the game to start a new session.
- **Error counter:** Tracks the number of incorrect matches and resets with each new game.
- **Sparkling stars background:** Adds a magical touch to the gameâ€™s atmosphere.

## How to Play

To start the game, the user will press the the Start Game button.

1. **Click to Reveal:** Click on a card to unveil its mystical symbol. Each card holds a unique image representing a facet of the tarot's wisdom. Take your time to absorb the energy of each card as it is revealed.
2. **Match the Symbols:** Click on another card to find its match. Use your memory to remember the positions of previously revealed cards.
3. **Find all Pairs:** Continue flipping cards and finding matching pairs until all cards are matched.
4. **Keep Track of Errors:** Each time you mismatch cards, the error counter will update, helping you track your progress.
5. **Restart the Game:** Click the "Start Game" button to reset the game and start a new round.

Each time the user matches the wrong cards, the error count will be updated to reflect the total number of errors.

When the user has successfully matched all the cards, a message will be displayed.

# Bugs
- Pressing "Start Game" multiple times initially showed different cards but reverted to the first set. This was fixed by resetting the board array correctly each time the game starts.
- Clicking Too Fast: If the player clicks on cards too quickly, the game might not register the selections properly and there is a slight delay.
